                          Leyte is one of the Philippines’ most historic provinces as it has witnessed many significant events that formed the history of the country. Being the site not only of a major rebellion against the Spaniards, Leyte is also the famous landing site of the US forces during World War II led by General Douglas MacArthur.

Leyte is passed through by many low mountain ranges similar to Samar and Visayan Islands. A rugged and impassable ridge runs from the northwestern section to the southeastern extremities. Many extinct volcanoes are also found in this province, the most important of which is Mahagnao.

Leyte is bounded on the north by Carigara Bay, San Juanico Strait and Leyte Gulf on the east, the Visayan Sea and Ormoc Sea on the west, and Southern Leyte on the south. The capital city is Tacloban which has the the most important seaport on the eastern coast while Ormoc City is the primary outlet on the western coast.
